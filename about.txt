#This is python script that lets users create a notifier to help them remember things throughout the day.

# The philosophy behind this project is create reminders throughout the day to help users remember whatever
tasks they'd like to be notified. I specifically made this for myself for the purpose of trading futures. I do not have a 
mentor over my shoulder asking me questions like "why did you buy here" or "the market is overbought". This is where notify comes 
into play and helps people like me be reminded of my actions. It can be tough to follow our plans when we have busy days or we 
have many things going on, with notify it'll be a useful tool to aid people in their daily life.
